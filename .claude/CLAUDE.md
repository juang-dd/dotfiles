## Interacting with Github

When interacting with Github (github.com), ALWAYS use `gh` on the command line.

When creating a pull request, apply the following:
1. Always include the line "Written using Claude Code" at the top of the PR description.
2. Always open the Poor request in draft mode.
3. If a pull request template is available, add a pull request description that follows that template. Otherwise, add a pull request description that contains the JIRA ticket associated with the changes, a description of the changes, why the changes are being done, and steps taken to validate the changes e.g. unit tests were added.
